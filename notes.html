    <h1>Colt Steel Bootstrap 4 Bootcamp</h1>
    <h2>
      These are going to be my notes for colt's bootstrap bootcamp, going to
      practice my git commands as much as possible, I'm 75% done with Colt's Git
      and Github Bootcamp, and the current version of BOOTSTRAP is BOOTSTRAP 5,
      not BOOTSTRAP 4, I'm going to go with BOOTSTRAP 5, and I suppose I may
      need to troubleshoot as the course progresses in case sections of Colt's
      BOOTSTRAP 4 course are now deprecated... We'll see how this goes..
      Actually no for now I'm going to replace the above link which refers to
      BOOTSTRAP 5, with the CDN link for BOOTSTRAP 4, I'm going to follow the
      course as best I can, and at the end take a look at BOOTSTRAP 5
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Section One: Prerequisites for the course:
      <ul>
        <b>
          <li>Comfortable with HTML</li>
          <li>Familiar with basic CSS</li>
          <li>No JavaScript experience needed</li>
        </b>
      </ul>
    </h2>
    <h2>So what exactly is Bootstrap?</h2>
    <h3>
      Well according to the offical docs, Bootstrap helps build responsive,
      mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end
      component library
    </h3>
    <h3>
      It's also sometimes referred to as a CSS framework, but at the end of the
      day it's a single CSS file, a single JS file that you include in your html
      documents
    </h3>
    <h3>
      These documents are very long, and technically behind the scenes, 50 files
      or so that are compiled into one.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      But what we do is we go into our html markup, and add classes to our
      elements.
      <em>The majority of this course is adding classes to html elements </em>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Bootstrap includes dozens and dozens of pre-built components like:
      <ul>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Navbars</li>
        <li>The super useful <em>GRID</em> system</li>
        <h3>
          The grid system is very crucial, some consider it to be the most
          useful thing, some people only use bootstrap for it's grid system
        </h3>
        <li>Utilities</li>
        <h3>
          In bootstrap 4 there are these 'utilities' that help us do common
          operations, they're very useful. Stuff for padding, margin, border, or
          spacing, all sorts of different things
        </h3>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Why use bootstrap? Pros and cons</h2>
    <h3>
      This section we'll go over the benefits of using bootstrap, and the next
      section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <h3>
        <li>Fast Development</li>
        <h3>
          If you're goal is making a nice looking, functional website bootstrap
          is amazing, but if you wanted to try to build a game playable in the
          browser bootstrap isn't going to help
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Browswer Compatibility</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Bootstrap supports almost all browsers, but the nice thing bootstrap
          does is coordinate the css based on the browser, not everything is
          unified across all broswers, but bootstrap will take care of that for
          you
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Responsive layouts</li>
          <h3>
            When you want to make responsive websites, and you don't use
            bootstrap, it's doable, just takes longer, and a bit more tedious
          </h3>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>It can be fun!</li>
        </h3>
      </h3>
    </ul>
    <h3>This section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap</h3>
    <h3>
      Do Bootstrap websites all look the same? If you're always using the same
      nav bars, and forms, aren't all your websites going to look the same?
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The answer is that yes they can, but also no, because we can always
      customize!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The point is that we use bootstrap as a tool, not the only thing we use to
      build a website. We use it in tandem with our own CSS
    </h3>
    <h2>Comparing bootstrap 3 and 4</h2>
    <h3>
      This course covers bootstrap 4, but bootstrap 4 is not the only version
      that's commonly used today, many people are using bootstrap 3
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's quickly go over some of the differences between bootstrap 3 and
      bootstrap 4, here's a list of new features in bootstrap 4
    </h3>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built on top of FLEXBOX</li>
        <li>Refactored most components</li>
        <li>Removed panels, thumbnails, and wells</li>
        <li>Added a new component: cards</li>
        <li>Uses 'rems' instead of 'px'</li>
        <li>New grid size/tier</li>
        <li>LESS to SASS</li>
        <li>Dropped glyphicons</li>
        <li>Many new utility classes</li>
      </ul>
      Bootstraps offical website has a comprehensive list of everything that's
      changed
    </h3>
    <h2>Section two: Environment setup</h2>
    <h3>
      In this course there are a few things we need to set up:
      <ul>
        <li>VSCODE as our default editor</li>
        <li>
          EMMET, which is included automatically in VSCODE, we can use
          docs.emmet.io to view full documentation
        </li>
        <li>The 'Live Server' extension, which updates on save</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>The BOOTSTRAP 4 documentation</h2>
    <h3>
      A good thing to keep in mind is that with every change in the version of
      BOOTSTRAP, like in colt's video, the current version for him is v4.1.3,
      but for me, as of 9/29/22, the current version of bootstrap is v5.2
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So if you google something, maybe you're having a problem with bootstrap,
      the answers may be deprecated, depending on what version of bootstrap the
      person is using
    </h3>
    <h2>Including BOOTSTRAP 4</h2>
    <h3>
      There are three main ways of including bootstrap:
      <ol>
        <li>Download it</li>
        <li>Use a CDN</li>
        <li>Package manager</li>
      </ol>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So using CDN seems the easiest / most seamless way of including Bootstrap
    </h3>
    <h2>First exercise: INTRO</h2>
    <h3>This is a quick exercise to show how powerful BOOTSTRAP can be,</h3>
    <h3>
      Okay quick note to myself here, I changed the CDN link at the top to
      reflect BOOTSTRAP v4.1.3, the same version Colt's working with in the
      course, I think I'll get more out of the course if I can see changes
      happen in real time vs wondering if using bootstrap 5, when Colt's using
      bootstrap 4.1.3 is causing problems. Also comment to myself: the below:
      /npm/boostrap must come last, the order of the script tags matter! JQEURY
      THEN POPPER THEN BOOTSTRAP
    </h3>
    <h2>BOOTSTRAP 4: Basics</h2>
    <h3>
      Learning Bootstrap is different from learning JAVASCRIPT, with JS it's
      important to understand the fundamentals first, there's an order of
      learning in JS, in Bootstrap it's not like this, bootstrap has standalone
      components
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-primary">
      Up first is: COLORS, colors is found under the utilities section on the
      Bootstrap documentation.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-success">
      One of the main criticisms of Bootstrap is that it all looks the same, but
      usually there are ways of customizing the components so theu don't all
      look the same
    </h3>
    <a href="" class="text-info">This is a link!!</a>
    <h3 class="text-primary bg-dark">
      Our text colors apply to any html element that has text, could be an h1,
      h2, h3, anchor tag etc.. and we set it with the following: 'h3 class =
      "text-primary"' which would apply the default primary color (blue in our
      case but we can change it!)
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-light bg-dark">
      We can also do the same thing with background color, and if we want to do
      both text and background together the syntax is: 'h3 class="text-light
      bg-dark"'
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Colt recommends changing the default colors, which we'll do later, because
      sticking with the defaults in bootstrap is one of the main criticisms of
      using bootstrap
    </h3>
    <h2>BUTTONS</h2>
    <h3>
      Let's go over our first component in Bootstrap, and you'll find buttons in
      the components section of bootstrap documentation listed alphabetically
    </h3>
    <h3>
      In order to create one of these button components we need to add a class
      of 'btn' and also specify a color for that button, so the syntax looks
      like: '< button type="button" class="btn" btn-primary" > Primary < /
      button >'
    </h3>
    <button class="btn text-light bg-primary">Click me!</button>
    <h3>
      Now as we notice, when we've added our button, it's all the way on the
      left edge, so what we can do is add a container, which will come up in the
      grid system, so let's put a new button below but inside of a container!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's type '.container' which all auto create a container class, and it
      also defaults to a div
    </h3>

    <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
    <div class="container">
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
    </div>
    <h3>
      So you can see all that did was give us some spacing, our old button is on
      the far left side but our new div class button is indented!
    </h3>
    <h3>Let's experiment and make a few more buttons</h3>
    <h2>REGULAR BUTTONS</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-primary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-secondary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-danger">I'm a button!</button>
    </div>
    <h3>
      And as we can see if we change the size of the window, our display is
      moving around, the buttons are moving dynamically as we shrink or expand
      our window
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Containers are the most basic layout in Bootstrap, and are required when
      using it's default grid system, we can choose a responsive fixed-width
      container (meaning it's 'max-width' changes at each breakpoint) or
      'fluid-width'( meaning it's 100% wide all of the time! )
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We can also make a link look like a button, we use the anchor tag followed
      by class , href, and a role. The syntax looks like: '< a class="btn
      btn-primary" href="#"" role="button" > Link < /a >'
    </h3>
    <h2>LINK BUTTONS</h2>
    <a href="" class="btn btn-success">This is a link</a>
    <h3>
      So the above looks like a button, but it's still an anchor tag, some more
      examples:
    </h3>
    <div class="container">
      <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">I'm a Link</a>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">I'm a Button</button>
      <input class="btn btn-primary" type="button" value="Input" />
      <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Submit" />
      <input class="btn btn-primary" type="reset" value="Reset" />
    </div>
    <h3>
      There are also outline buttons, so instead of having the background color
      set, it will just be the outline of the button that's colored, like this:
    </h3>
    <h2>OUTLINE BUTTONS:</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Secondary</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-success">Success</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger">Danger</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-warning">Warning</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Info</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-light">Light</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-dark">Dark</button>
    </div>
    <h3>Next we have different sizes for buttons,</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-lg">
        Large button
      </button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-success btn-sm">
        Small button
      </button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger">Danger</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-primary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-secondary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info btn-block">
        I'm a block button!
      </button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info btn-block btn-lg">
        I'm a large block button!
      </button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info btn-block btn-sm">
        I'm a small block button!
      </button>
    </div>
    <h3>The last thing here is: 'ACTIVE STATE' and 'DISABLED STATE' buttons</h3>
    <h3>
      So we can add active inside our btn class to make it appear active, and we
      can do the same thing with disabled, heres an example:
    </h3>
    <h3>Active</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <a href="#" class="btn text-light bg-success active" role="button"
        >I'm a button!</a
      >
      <a href="#" class="btn text-light bg-primary active" role="button"
        >I'm a button!</a
      >
    </div>
    <h3>Disabled</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success" disabled>
        I'm a disabled button!
      </button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-primary" disabled>
        I'm a disabled button!
      </button>
    </div>
    <h3>
      < button class="btn text-light bg-primary" disabled> the 'disabled' goes
      outside of the class=" ", because 'disabled' is an attribute, not a class
    </h3>
    <h3>
      These are the buttons that will often come up throughout the course,
      you'll get used to them more as we go.
