    <h2>So what exactly is Bootstrap?</h2>
    <h3>
      Well according to the offical docs, Bootstrap helps build responsive,
      mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end
      component library
    </h3>
    <h3>
      It's also sometimes referred to as a CSS framework, but at the end of the
      day it's a single CSS file, a single JS file that you include in your html
      documents
    </h3>
    <h3>
      These documents are very long, and technically behind the scenes, 50 files
      or so that are compiled into one.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      But what we do is we go into our html markup, and add classes to our
      elements.
      <em>The majority of this course is adding classes to html elements </em>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Bootstrap includes dozens and dozens of pre-built components like:
      <ul>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Navbars</li>
        <li>The super useful <em>GRID</em> system</li>
        <h3>
          The grid system is very crucial, some consider it to be the most
          useful thing, some people only use bootstrap for it's grid system
        </h3>
        <li>Utilities</li>
        <h3>
          In bootstrap 4 there are these 'utilities' that help us do common
          operations, they're very useful. Stuff for padding, margin, border, or
          spacing, all sorts of different things
        </h3>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Why use bootstrap? Pros and cons</h2>
    <h3>
      This section we'll go over the benefits of using bootstrap, and the next
      section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <h3>
        <li>Fast Development</li>
        <h3>
          If you're goal is making a nice looking, functional website bootstrap
          is amazing, but if you wanted to try to build a game playable in the
          browser bootstrap isn't going to help
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Browswer Compatibility</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Bootstrap supports almost all browsers, but the nice thing bootstrap
          does is coordinate the css based on the browser, not everything is
          unified across all broswers, but bootstrap will take care of that for
          you
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Responsive layouts</li>
          <h3>
            When you want to make responsive websites, and you don't use
            bootstrap, it's doable, just takes longer, and a bit more tedious
          </h3>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>It can be fun!</li>
        </h3>
      </h3>
    </ul>
    <h3>This section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap</h3>
    <h3>
      Do Bootstrap websites all look the same? If you're always using the same
      nav bars, and forms, aren't all your websites going to look the same?
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The answer is that yes they can, but also no, because we can always
      customize!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The point is that we use bootstrap as a tool, not the only thing we use to
      build a website. We use it in tandem with our own CSS
    </h3>
