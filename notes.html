    <h1>Colt Steel Bootstrap 4 Bootcamp</h1>
    <h2>
      These are going to be my notes for colt's bootstrap bootcamp, going to
      practice my git commands as much as possible, I'm 75% done with Colt's Git
      and Github Bootcamp, and the current version of BOOTSTRAP is BOOTSTRAP 5,
      not BOOTSTRAP 4, I'm going to go with BOOTSTRAP 5, and I suppose I may
      need to troubleshoot as the course progresses in case sections of Colt's
      BOOTSTRAP 4 course are now deprecated... We'll see how this goes..
      Actually no for now I'm going to replace the above link which refers to
      BOOTSTRAP 5, with the CDN link for BOOTSTRAP 4, I'm going to follow the
      course as best I can, and at the end take a look at BOOTSTRAP 5
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Section One: Prerequisites for the course:
      <ul>
        <b>
          <li>Comfortable with HTML</li>
          <li>Familiar with basic CSS</li>
          <li>No JavaScript experience needed</li>
        </b>
      </ul>
    </h2>
    <h2>So what exactly is Bootstrap?</h2>
    <h3>
      Well according to the offical docs, Bootstrap helps build responsive,
      mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end
      component library
    </h3>
    <h3>
      It's also sometimes referred to as a CSS framework, but at the end of the
      day it's a single CSS file, a single JS file that you include in your html
      documents
    </h3>
    <h3>
      These documents are very long, and technically behind the scenes, 50 files
      or so that are compiled into one.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      But what we do is we go into our html markup, and add classes to our
      elements.
      <em>The majority of this course is adding classes to html elements </em>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Bootstrap includes dozens and dozens of pre-built components like:
      <ul>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Navbars</li>
        <li>The super useful <em>GRID</em> system</li>
        <h3>
          The grid system is very crucial, some consider it to be the most
          useful thing, some people only use bootstrap for it's grid system
        </h3>
        <li>Utilities</li>
        <h3>
          In bootstrap 4 there are these 'utilities' that help us do common
          operations, they're very useful. Stuff for padding, margin, border, or
          spacing, all sorts of different things
        </h3>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Why use bootstrap? Pros and cons</h2>
    <h3>
      This section we'll go over the benefits of using bootstrap, and the next
      section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <h3>
        <li>Fast Development</li>
        <h3>
          If you're goal is making a nice looking, functional website bootstrap
          is amazing, but if you wanted to try to build a game playable in the
          browser bootstrap isn't going to help
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Browswer Compatibility</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Bootstrap supports almost all browsers, but the nice thing bootstrap
          does is coordinate the css based on the browser, not everything is
          unified across all broswers, but bootstrap will take care of that for
          you
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Responsive layouts</li>
          <h3>
            When you want to make responsive websites, and you don't use
            bootstrap, it's doable, just takes longer, and a bit more tedious
          </h3>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>It can be fun!</li>
        </h3>
      </h3>
    </ul>
    <h3>This section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap</h3>
    <h3>
      Do Bootstrap websites all look the same? If you're always using the same
      nav bars, and forms, aren't all your websites going to look the same?
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The answer is that yes they can, but also no, because we can always
      customize!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The point is that we use bootstrap as a tool, not the only thing we use to
      build a website. We use it in tandem with our own CSS
    </h3>
    <h2>Comparing bootstrap 3 and 4</h2>
    <h3>
      This course covers bootstrap 4, but bootstrap 4 is not the only version
      that's commonly used today, many people are using bootstrap 3
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's quickly go over some of the differences between bootstrap 3 and
      bootstrap 4, here's a list of new features in bootstrap 4
    </h3>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built on top of FLEXBOX</li>
        <li>Refactored most components</li>
        <li>Removed panels, thumbnails, and wells</li>
        <li>Added a new component: cards</li>
        <li>Uses 'rems' instead of 'px'</li>
        <li>New grid size/tier</li>
        <li>LESS to SASS</li>
        <li>Dropped glyphicons</li>
        <li>Many new utility classes</li>
      </ul>
      Bootstraps offical website has a comprehensive list of everything that's
      changed
    </h3>
    <h2>Section two: Environment setup</h2>
    <h3>
      In this course there are a few things we need to set up:
      <ul>
        <li>VSCODE as our default editor</li>
        <li>
          EMMET, which is included automatically in VSCODE, we can use
          docs.emmet.io to view full documentation
        </li>
        <li>The 'Live Server' extension, which updates on save</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>The BOOTSTRAP 4 documentation</h2>
    <h3>
      A good thing to keep in mind is that with every change in the version of
      BOOTSTRAP, like in colt's video, the current version for him is v4.1.3,
      but for me, as of 9/29/22, the current version of bootstrap is v5.2
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So if you google something, maybe you're having a problem with bootstrap,
      the answers may be deprecated, depending on what version of bootstrap the
      person is using
    </h3>
    <h2>Including BOOTSTRAP 4</h2>
    <h3>
      There are three main ways of including bootstrap:
      <ol>
        <li>Download it</li>
        <li>Use a CDN</li>
        <li>Package manager</li>
      </ol>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So using CDN seems the easiest / most seamless way of including Bootstrap
    </h3>
    <h2>First exercise: INTRO</h2>
    <h3>This is a quick exercise to show how powerful BOOTSTRAP can be,</h3>
    <h3>
      Okay quick note to myself here, I changed the CDN link at the top to
      reflect BOOTSTRAP v4.1.3, the same version Colt's working with in the
      course, I think I'll get more out of the course if I can see changes
      happen in real time vs wondering if using bootstrap 5, when Colt's using
      bootstrap 4.1.3 is causing problems. Also comment to myself: the below:
      /npm/boostrap must come last, the order of the script tags matter! JQEURY
      THEN POPPER THEN BOOTSTRAP
    </h3>
    <h2>BOOTSTRAP 4: Basics</h2>
    <h3>
      Learning Bootstrap is different from learning JAVASCRIPT, with JS it's
      important to understand the fundamentals first, there's an order of
      learning in JS, in Bootstrap it's not like this, bootstrap has standalone
      components
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-primary">
      Up first is: COLORS, colors is found under the utilities section on the
      Bootstrap documentation.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-success">
      One of the main criticisms of Bootstrap is that it all looks the same, but
      usually there are ways of customizing the components so theu don't all
      look the same
    </h3>
    <a href="" class="text-info">This is a link!!</a>
    <h3 class="text-primary bg-dark">
      Our text colors apply to any html element that has text, could be an h1,
      h2, h3, anchor tag etc.. and we set it with the following: 'h3 class =
      "text-primary"' which would apply the default primary color (blue in our
      case but we can change it!)
    </h3>
    <h3 class="text-light bg-dark">
      We can also do the same thing with background color, and if we want to do
      both text and background together the syntax is: 'h3 class="text-light
      bg-dark"'
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Colt recommends changing the default colors, which we'll do later, because
      sticking with the defaults in bootstrap is one of the main criticisms of
      using bootstrap
    </h3>
    <h2>BUTTONS</h2>
    <h3>
      Let's go over our first component in Bootstrap, and you'll find buttons in
      the components section of bootstrap documentation listed alphabetically
    </h3>
    <h3>
      In order to create one of these button components we need to add a class
      of 'btn' and also specify a color for that button, so the syntax looks
      like: '< button type="button" class="btn" btn-primary" > Primary < /
      button >'
    </h3>
    <button class="btn text-light bg-primary">Click me!</button>
    <h3>
      Now as we notice, when we've added our button, it's all the way on the
      left edge, so what we can do is add a container, which will come up in the
      grid system, so let's put a new button below but inside of a container!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's type '.container' which all auto create a container class, and it
      also defaults to a div
    </h3>

    <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
    <div class="container">
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
    </div>
    <h3>
      So you can see all that did was give us some spacing, our old button is on
      the far left side but our new div class button is indented!
    </h3>
    <h3>Let's experiment and make a few more buttons</h3>
    <h2>REGULAR BUTTONS</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-primary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-secondary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-danger">I'm a button!</button>
    </div>
    <h3>
      And as we can see if we change the size of the window, our display is
      moving around, the buttons are moving dynamically as we shrink or expand
      our window
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Containers are the most basic layout in Bootstrap, and are required when
      using it's default grid system, we can choose a responsive fixed-width
      container (meaning it's 'max-width' changes at each breakpoint) or
      'fluid-width'( meaning it's 100% wide all of the time! )
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We can also make a link look like a button, we use the anchor tag followed
      by class , href, and a role. The syntax looks like: '< a class="btn
      btn-primary" href="#"" role="button" > Link < /a >'
    </h3>
    <h2>LINK BUTTONS</h2>
    <button type="button" class="btn text-success btn-link">
      Make me look like a link, not a button
    </button>
    <h3>
      So the above looks like a button, but it's still an anchor tag, some more
      examples:
    </h3>
    <div class="container">
      <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">I'm a Link</a>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">I'm a Button</button>
      <input class="btn btn-primary" type="button" value="Input" />
      <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Submit" />
      <input class="btn btn-primary" type="reset" value="Reset" />
    </div>
    <h3>
      There are also outline buttons, so instead of having the background color
      set, it will just be the outline of the button that's colored, like this:
    </h3>
    <h2>OUTLINE BUTTONS:</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Secondary</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-success">Success</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger">Danger</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-warning">Warning</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Info</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-light">Light</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-dark">Dark</button>
    </div>
    <h3>Next we have different sizes for buttons,</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-lg">
        Large button
      </button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-success btn-sm">
        Small button
      </button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger">Danger</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-primary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-secondary">I'm a button!</button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info btn-block">
        I'm a block button!
      </button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info btn-block btn-lg">
        I'm a large block button!
      </button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-info btn-block btn-sm">
        I'm a small block button!
      </button>
    </div>
    <h3>The last thing here is: 'ACTIVE STATE' and 'DISABLED STATE' buttons</h3>
    <h3>
      So we can add active inside our btn class to make it appear active, and we
      can do the same thing with disabled, heres an example:
    </h3>
    <h3>Active</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <a href="#" class="btn text-light bg-success active" role="button"
        >I'm a button!</a
      >
      <a href="#" class="btn text-light bg-primary active" role="button"
        >I'm a button!</a
      >
    </div>
    <h3>Disabled</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <button class="btn text-light bg-success" disabled>
        I'm a disabled button!
      </button>
      <button class="btn text-light bg-primary" disabled>
        I'm a disabled button!
      </button>
    </div>
    <h3>
      < button class="btn text-light bg-primary" disabled> the 'disabled' goes
      outside of the class=" ", because 'disabled' is an attribute, not a class
    </h3>
    <h3>
      These are the buttons that will often come up throughout the course,
      you'll get used to them more as we go.
    </h3>
    <h2>BOOTSTRAP TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
    <h3>
      This is documentation you can find under content, not contents, on the
      bootstrap docs:
    </h3>
    <div class="container">
      <a
        href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/typography/"
        class="btn text-light bg-primary active btn-lg"
        role="button"
        >Link to bootstrap docs</a
      >
    </div>
    <h3>
      This page displays the default styles that are applied to 'h1' through
      'h6'
    </h3>
    <h1>h1. Bootstrap heading</h1>
    <h2>h2. Bootstrap heading</h2>
    <h3>h3. Bootstrap heading</h3>
    <h4>h4. Bootstrap heading</h4>
    <h5>h5. Bootstrap heading</h5>
    <h6>h6. Bootstrap heading</h6>
    <h3>
      Now keep in mind, these defaults are bootstrap defaults, if we had the
      same h1 through h6 on a regular, non-bootsrapped html page, they would
      look different, h1-h6 are all little smaller on a regular html page,
    </h3>
    <h3>
      There are also utility classes h1-h6, we can add these to any sort of text
      content, and that specified paragraph tag will match the styling of an h1
      or h2 etc..
    </h3>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="h1">h1. Bootstrap heading</p>
      <p class="h1">Make me an h1!</p>
      <p class="h2">h2. Bootstrap heading</p>

      <p class="h5">h5. Bootstrap heading</p>
      <p class="h6">h6. Bootstrap heading</p>
    </div>
    <h3>
      Keep in mind semantically we should never have more than one h1 tag, just
      like we shouldn't have more than one title on a page, but if we want to
      style a peice of text with the same content size as an h1, we can use
      class="h1"
    </h3>
    <h3>Here's the same paragraph as above but with an h1 class</h3>
    <p class="h1">

    <h2>
      ======================================================================
    </h2>
    <h3>We can also use headings and fancy display headings:</h3>
    <h3>
      Fancy display heading
      <small class="text-muted">With faded secondary text</small>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Fancy display heading
      <small class="text-danger">With faded secondary text</small>
    </h3>
    <h2>
      ======================================================================
    </h2>
    <h3>
      We can also use the display class, to give our headings a more pronouced
      and evident font-size / line-height:
    </h3>
    <h1 class="display-1">Display 1</h1>
    <h1 class="display-2">Display 2</h1>
    <h1 class="display-3">Display 3</h1>
    <h1 class="display-4">Display 4</h1>
    <h3>
      Next we have a class called 'lead', lead makes a paragraph stand out
    </h3>
    <h3>Regular paragraph below</h3>

    <h2>
      BOOTSTRAP JUMBOTRON: Lightweight, flexible component for showcasing hero
      unit style content.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The reason we're looking at this now is because everything we've seen so
      far comes together in the JUMBOTRON, and JUMBOTRON is a way to highlight
      extra attention on feature content / information
    </h3>
    <h3>
      WE NEVER want to leave our jumbotrons unstyled, only if you're using it
      for personal purposes, but for display, it must be customized!
    </h3>
    <h2>JUMBOTRON example:</h2>
    <div class="jumbotron">
      <h1 class="display-3">
        Hello, world! Also this JUMBOTRON is NOT inside of a container div, but
        the JUMBOTRON below is inside a container div
      </h1>
      <p class="lead">
        This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for
        calling extra attention to featured content or information.
      </p>
      <hr class="my-2" />
      <p>
        It uses utility classes for typography and spacing to space content out
        within the larger container.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#!" role="button"
          >Some action</a
        >
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h2 class="display-2">Hello world</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This is a jumbotron hero / info display, this is our 'lead' paragraph
          that goes along with our heading
        </p>
        <hr class="my-4" />
        <p>
          Above this 'p' tag is a divider, the divider is used to separate the
          jumbotron
        </p>
        <hr class="my-2" />
        <p>Here's another, and a button below!</p>

    <h2>Now let's look at FLUID JUMBOTRON</h2>
    <h3>
      To make the jumbotron full width, and without rounded corners, add the .
      jumbotron-fluid modifier class and add a . container / . container-fluid
      div within
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's add one now, remember, we don't add this inside of a container div
    </h3>
    <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
      <h1 class="display-3">Adopt a Pet</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      Now this isn't ideal, now our text is all the way on the left side, so
      usually we'll add our container INSIDE the jumbotron div, to give our text
      / content some space:
    </h3>
    <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
      <div class="container">
        <h1 class="display-4">Adopt a Pet</h1>

    <h3>
      It's important we change the default grey backgorund of our jumbotrons,
      remember the main downfall of BOOTSTRAP is it makes a lot of it's sites
      look 'same-ish', we must customize our BOOTSTRAP content to avoid this!
    </h3>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="jumbotron bg-dark text-light">
        <h1 class="display-3">Adopt a Pet</h1>

    <h3>
      Let's customize some more! "Add div id of 'blue', then add our style tag :
      #blue{ background: b lue ; }
    </h3>
    <style>
      #blue {
        background-color: blue;
        color: antiquewhite;
      }
      #magenta {
        background-color: magenta;
        color: black;
      }
    </style>
    <div class="container">
      <div id="blue" class="jumbotron">

          nationwide every year!
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, this shade of blue is NOT available in the default
          BOOTSTRAP settings, obviously this shade of blue isn't visually
          appealing but it's to illustrate that we NEED to make alterations to
          BOOTSTRAPS default colors it doesn't look like every other BOOTSTRAP
          site
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll do the same with the button below, add an id selector inside our
          style tags above that will target this button
        </p>

    <h3>
      Okay so that's it for jumbotrons, I noticed that if you set the font color
      inside the class selector of a button or div, that font color has priority
      over the style tag, at least it seems to... I always thought id selectors
      had top specifiity but maybe it's different in these class = btn
      text-light or btn text-danger etc..

    <h2>BOOTSTRAP BASICS EXERCISE</h2>
    <h3>
      We're going to do an exercise to test your basic knowledge of what we've
      learned so far, let's practice!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Okay so the exercise went well, except at the end, the link to the forest
      image colt provided was not applying, I tried everything but his image
      link wouldn't load, I tested by inputting other fog images, and all of
      them worked, maybe the unplash link colt provided is deprecated.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      I was wrong, after watching colt work through the exercise, the image link
      he provided was very large, so we needed to change the background position
      to center, this I did not get right, I thought the link was messed up in
      some way!
