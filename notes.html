    <h2>So what exactly is Bootstrap?</h2>
    <h3>
      Well according to the offical docs, Bootstrap helps build responsive,
      mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end
      component library
    </h3>
    <h3>
      It's also sometimes referred to as a CSS framework, but at the end of the
      day it's a single CSS file, a single JS file that you include in your html
      documents
    </h3>
    <h3>
      These documents are very long, and technically behind the scenes, 50 files
      or so that are compiled into one.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      But what we do is we go into our html markup, and add classes to our
      elements.
      <em>The majority of this course is adding classes to html elements </em>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Bootstrap includes dozens and dozens of pre-built components like:
      <ul>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Navbars</li>
        <li>The super useful <em>GRID</em> system</li>
        The grid system is very crucial, some consider it to be the most useful
        thing, some people only use bootstrap for it's grid system
        <li>Utilities</li>
        In bootstrap 4 there are these 'utilities' that help us do common
        operations, they're very useful. Stuff for padding, margin, border, or
        spacing, all sorts of different things
      </ul>
