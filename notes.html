    <h1>Colt Steel Bootstrap 4 Bootcamp</h1>
    <h2>
      These are going to be my notes for colt's bootstrap bootcamp, going to
      practice my git commands as much as possible, I'm 75% done with Colt's Git
      and Github Bootcamp, and the current version of BOOTSTRAP is BOOTSTRAP 5,
      not BOOTSTRAP 4, I'm going to go with BOOTSTRAP 5, and I suppose I may
      need to troubleshoot as the course progresses in case sections of Colt's
      BOOTSTRAP 4 course are now deprecated... We'll see how this goes.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Section One: Prerequisites for the course:
      <ul>
        <b>
          <li>Comfortable with HTML</li>
          <li>Familiar with basic CSS</li>
          <li>No JavaScript experience needed</li>
        </b>
      </ul>
    </h2>
    <h2>So what exactly is Bootstrap?</h2>
    <h3>
      Well according to the offical docs, Bootstrap helps build responsive,
      mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end
      component library
    </h3>
    <h3>
      It's also sometimes referred to as a CSS framework, but at the end of the
      day it's a single CSS file, a single JS file that you include in your html
      documents
    </h3>
    <h3>
      These documents are very long, and technically behind the scenes, 50 files
      or so that are compiled into one.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      But what we do is we go into our html markup, and add classes to our
      elements.
      <em>The majority of this course is adding classes to html elements </em>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Bootstrap includes dozens and dozens of pre-built components like:
      <ul>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Navbars</li>
        <li>The super useful <em>GRID</em> system</li>
        <h3>
          The grid system is very crucial, some consider it to be the most
          useful thing, some people only use bootstrap for it's grid system
        </h3>
        <li>Utilities</li>
        <h3>
          In bootstrap 4 there are these 'utilities' that help us do common
          operations, they're very useful. Stuff for padding, margin, border, or
          spacing, all sorts of different things
        </h3>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Why use bootstrap? Pros and cons</h2>
    <h3>
      This section we'll go over the benefits of using bootstrap, and the next
      section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <h3>
        <li>Fast Development</li>
        <h3>
          If you're goal is making a nice looking, functional website bootstrap
          is amazing, but if you wanted to try to build a game playable in the
          browser bootstrap isn't going to help
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Browswer Compatibility</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Bootstrap supports almost all browsers, but the nice thing bootstrap
          does is coordinate the css based on the browser, not everything is
          unified across all broswers, but bootstrap will take care of that for
          you
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Responsive layouts</li>
          <h3>
            When you want to make responsive websites, and you don't use
            bootstrap, it's doable, just takes longer, and a bit more tedious
          </h3>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>It can be fun!</li>
        </h3>
      </h3>
    </ul>
    <h3>This section we'll go over the downsides of bootstrap</h3>
    <h3>
      Do Bootstrap websites all look the same? If you're always using the same
      nav bars, and forms, aren't all your websites going to look the same?
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The answer is that yes they can, but also no, because we can always
      customize!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The point is that we use bootstrap as a tool, not the only thing we use to
      build a website. We use it in tandem with our own CSS
    </h3>
    <h2>Comparing bootstrap 3 and 4</h2>
    <h3>
      This course covers bootstrap 4, but bootstrap 4 is not the only version
      that's commonly used today, many people are using bootstrap 3
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's quickly go over some of the differences between bootstrap 3 and
      bootstrap 4, here's a list of new features in bootstrap 4
    </h3>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built on top of FLEXBOX</li>
        <li>Refactored most components</li>
        <li>Removed panels, thumbnails, and wells</li>
        <li>Added a new component: cards</li>
        <li>Uses 'rems' instead of 'px'</li>
        <li>New grid size/tier</li>
        <li>LESS to SASS</li>
        <li>Dropped glyphicons</li>
        <li>Many new utility classes</li>
      </ul>
      Bootstraps offical website has a comprehensive list of everything that's
      changed
    </h3>
    <h2>Section two: Environment setup</h2>
    <h3>
      In this course there are a few things we need to set up:
      <ul>
        <li>VSCODE as our default editor</li>
        <li>
          EMMET, which is included automatically in VSCODE, we can use
          docs.emmet.io to view full documentation
        </li>
        <li>The 'Live Server' extension, which updates on save</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>The BOOTSTRAP 4 documentation</h2>
    <h3>
      A good thing to keep in mind is that with every change in the version of
      BOOTSTRAP, like in colt's video, the current version for him is v4.1.3,
      but for me, as of 9/29/22, the current version of bootstrap is v5.2
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So if you google something, maybe you're having a problem with bootstrap,
      the answers may be deprecated, depending on what version of bootstrap the
      person is using
    </h3>
    <h2>Including BOOTSTRAP 4</h2>
    <h3>
      There are three main ways of including bootstrap:
      <ol>
        <li>Download it</li>
        <li>Use a CDN</li>
        <li>Package manager</li>
      </ol>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So using CDN seems the easiest / most seamless way of including Bootstrap
