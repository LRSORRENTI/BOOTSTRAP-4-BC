    </h1>

        We're at the end of the course, we're going to build a couple projects
        that incorporate everything we've covered, first is the 'Aurora Grove'
        second is the 'Museum of Candy'
      </p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        The website itself should be resposive, it should change based on screen
        size dynamically, and it will encompass all of the components,
        utilities, colors, using SASS to style even further we've used in the
        course
      </p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        Okay so after trial and error I got the project starter set up, the
        reason I was having problems had to do with the file paths, after
        carefully making sure all the correct pathing was set up, the main
        app.css finally imported all the root stuff from bootstrap
