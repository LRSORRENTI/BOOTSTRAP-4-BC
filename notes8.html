      <b><u>Building the Aurora Grove</u></b>
    </h1>
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <p class="h3">
        We're at the end of the course, we're going to build a couple projects
        that incorporate everything we've covered, first is the 'Aurora Grove'
        second is the 'Museum of Candy'
      </p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        The website itself should be resposive, it should change based on screen
        size dynamically, and it will encompass all of the components,
        utilities, colors, using SASS to style even further we've used in the
        course
      </p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        Okay so after trial and error I got the project starter set up, the
        reason I was having problems had to do with the file paths, after
        carefully making sure all the correct pathing was set up, the main
        app.css finally imported all the root stuff from bootstrap
      </p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        Okay so just finished up the navbar, used @media set to 768 px to change
        how the navbar functions on different screen sizes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="h3 mt-4">Next up we're building the showcase</p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        Built the main display with a transparent overlay, added the navbar,
        main booking button, utilizing the grid system to make a resposive
        display along with images / text, added two cards with buttons, and
        added some blockquotes under the cards
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        Okay so I haven't updated my notes in awhile, but the AURORA GROVE,
        project is finished, I had some problems when I messed up the script
        tags, implementing the modal in the specified way, and setting the
        correct breakpoints for small / medium screen sizes
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="h3 mt-4">Up next is the BONUS PROJECT "MUSEUM OF CANDY"</p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        From Colt: 'This project is marked as a "BONUS" section because it comes
        from another one of my courses which also covers bootstrap. It is the
        only section that is not 100% created exclusively for this course. I
        don't want to try and pass it off as a brand-new original project, but I
        thought it was worth including for students who are not part of my Web
        Developer Bootcamp course.'
      </p>
      <p class="h3 mt-4">
        Okay so the basic set-up of the page has been made, using a very
        'strawberry-candy'esque color palette, looks pretty good so far.
      </p>
